        <h1>Operation Rising Lion: Israel’s Strategic Strike on Iran’s Nuclear and Military Infrastructure</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>On June 12, 2025, Israel launched <strong>Operation Rising Lion</strong>, a meticulously planned, large-scale air campaign targeting Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile facilities, and senior military leadership. Described by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a “pre-emptive, precise, combined offensive,” the operation involved approximately 200 fighter jets, including advanced F-35I Adir, F-15I Ra’am, and F-16I Sufa aircraft. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), in coordination with the Mossad, employed a range of sophisticated munitions, including GBU-28 bunker busters and Rampage missiles, to strike critical targets across Iran, such as the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, military sites in Kermanshah and Hamadan provinces, and Iran’s air defense systems. This blog provides a detailed analysis of the operation, its strategic objectives, execution, and implications, drawing on open-source information and recent reports.</p>

        <h2>Background and Strategic Context</h2>
        <p>The Iran-Israel conflict has been marked by decades of hostility, with Iran’s nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program posing a significant threat to Israel’s security. Israel’s Begin Doctrine, which emphasizes preemptive strikes to prevent adversaries from acquiring nuclear weapons, has guided its military strategy, as seen in past operations like the 1981 strike on Iraq’s Osirak reactor and the 2007 attack on Syria’s Al-Kibar facility. By 2025, Israeli intelligence assessed that Iran had reached the capacity to produce up to 15 nuclear bombs, with enriched uranium warheads and delivery systems capable of reaching Israel, marking a “point of no return” that necessitated immediate action.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://www.twz.com/air/israel-strikes-iran)
        <p>Operation Rising Lion was launched in the context of heightened regional tensions, including the ongoing Gaza war and the weakening of Iran’s proxy forces, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. The operation aimed to neutralize Iran’s nuclear capabilities, degrade its ballistic missile arsenal, and eliminate key military and scientific figures, leveraging both conventional airpower and covert operations to achieve strategic surprise.</p>

        <h2>Execution of Operation Rising Lion</h2>
        <h3>Air Campaign and Munitions</h3>
        <p>The IDF deployed approximately 200 fighter jets, including the stealth-capable F-35I Adir, the versatile F-15I Ra’am, and the multirole F-16I Sufa. These aircraft were equipped with a range of precision-guided munitions tailored to specific targets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GBU-28 Bunker Busters</strong>: Designed to penetrate hardened targets, these 5,000-pound bombs were likely used against underground facilities, such as those at Natanz and Kermanshah, to destroy critical nuclear and missile infrastructure.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/iran-israel-air-defense-rising-lion/)
            <li><strong>Rampage Missiles</strong>: These supersonic, long-range, air-to-ground missiles provided standoff capabilities, allowing Israeli jets to strike targets while minimizing exposure to air defenses.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.twz.com/air/israels-operation-to-destroy-irans-nuclear-program-enters-new-phase)
            <li><strong>GBU-31 JDAMs and GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs</strong>: The F-15I and F-16I aircraft carried these precision-guided munitions, with the GBU-39s offering high accuracy and minimal collateral damage for strikes on fixed and dynamic targets.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2025/june/iran-israel-conflict-quicklook-analysis-operation-rising-lion)
        </ul>
        <p>The operation’s first wave involved over 330 munitions dropped on more than 100 targets, including nuclear facilities, ballistic missile sites, and air defense systems. The F-35I’s stealth capabilities allowed it to penetrate Iranian airspace undetected, while the F-15I’s long-range capabilities, augmented by conformal fuel tanks, reduced reliance on mid-air refueling.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2025/june/iran-israel-conflict-quicklook-analysis-operation-rising-lion)[](https://www.twz.com/air/israel-escalates-to-attacking-iranian-energy-targets-after-ballistic-missiles-hit-tel-aviv)

        <h3>Key Targets</h3>
        <p>The operation focused on three primary target sets:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Natanz Nuclear Enrichment Facility</strong>: The aboveground portion of Natanz, Iran’s primary uranium enrichment site, was severely damaged, with satellite imagery confirming the destruction of the pilot fuel enrichment plant and damage to two other buildings, including the electrical substation.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.twz.com/air/israels-operation-to-destroy-irans-nuclear-program-enters-new-phase)[](https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-israel-couldnt-wait-anymore-to-strike-iran-idf-confirms-hitting-isfahan-nuclear-site/)
            <li><strong>Ballistic Missile Facilities in Kermanshah and Hamadan</strong>: The Kermanshah Underground Missile Facility and sites in Hamadan, used for missile storage and launches, were struck, with reports of secondary explosions indicating significant destruction.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://theaviationist.com/2025/06/13/israel-attack-iran-details/)[](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-rising-lion-first-72-hours)
            <li><strong>Air Defense Systems and Airbases</strong>: Israeli strikes targeted radar installations, surface-to-air missile launchers, and airbases like Nojeh in Hamadan and Tabriz, crippling Iran’s ability to counter aerial attacks.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.twz.com/air/israels-operation-to-destroy-irans-nuclear-program-enters-new-phase)[](https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-israel-couldnt-wait-anymore-to-strike-iran-idf-confirms-hitting-isfahan-nuclear-site/)
        </ul>
        <p>Additional strikes hit energy infrastructure, government buildings, and military command centers, including the IRGC’s Aerospace Forces headquarters, with reports indicating the elimination of key figures like General Hossein Salami and Mohammad Bagheri.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-rising-lion-first-72-hours)[](https://www.twz.com/air/israel-hid-drones-missiles-around-iran-to-target-nuclear-facilities-and-more-report)

        <h3>Mossad’s Covert Operations</h3>
        <p>A critical component of Operation Rising Lion was the Mossad’s covert activities, which involved smuggling drones and precision-guided munitions, such as Rafael Spike NLOS missiles, into Iran over months or even years. Mossad operatives established drone bases near Tehran, launching one-way attack drones and loitering munitions to neutralize air defense systems and missile launchers before the main air campaign began. Reports suggest a secret drone factory was set up in Shahr-e Rey, near Tehran, highlighting the operation’s audacity and sophistication.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://www.twz.com/air/israel-hid-drones-missiles-around-iran-to-target-nuclear-facilities-and-more-report)[](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/iran-israel-air-defense-rising-lion/)
        <p>The Mossad also conducted targeted assassinations, eliminating key IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists, reportedly by luring them into a meeting that was subsequently struck. This decapitation strategy disrupted Iran’s command-and-control structure, further weakening its response.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://theaviationist.com/2025/06/13/israel-attack-iran-details/)[](https://www.twz.com/air/israel-hid-drones-missiles-around-iran-to-target-nuclear-facilities-and-more-report)

        <h2>Strategic Outcomes and Impact</h2>
        <h3>Immediate Effects</h3>
        <p>Operation Rising Lion achieved significant tactical success:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air Superiority</strong>: The IDF gained control of Iranian airspace within hours, with no confirmed losses of Israeli aircraft, despite Iranian claims of downing an F-35.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/iran-israel-air-defense-rising-lion/)[](https://news.sky.com/story/iran-claims-it-has-shot-down-four-israeli-jets-as-it-fires-missiles-in-response-to-fridays-attacks-13383379)
            <li><strong>Nuclear Program Setback</strong>: The destruction of Natanz’s aboveground facilities disrupted Iran’s uranium enrichment, though underground centrifuges at Natanz and Fordo remain a challenge.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/12/world/israel-iran-us-nuclear)[](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/14/israel-iran-attacks-live-tehran-tel-aviv/)
            <li><strong>Ballistic Missile Degradation</strong>: Israel destroyed approximately one-third of Iran’s mobile missile launchers, limiting its retaliatory capabilities.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/16/nx-s1-5435292/israel-iran-missile-defense-nuclear)
            <li><strong>Leadership Losses</strong>: The elimination of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists dealt a blow to Iran’s military and scientific expertise.<span class="source"></span></li>[](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-rising-lion-first-72-hours)[](https://www.twz.com/air/israel-hid-drones-missiles-around-iran-to-target-nuclear-facilities-and-more-report)
        </ul>
        <p>However, Iran’s retaliation, dubbed Operation True Promise III, involved over 550 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones targeting Israeli cities and military sites, causing civilian casualties and damage in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Israel’s Iron Dome and U.S.-provided THAAD systems intercepted many projectiles, but some missiles broke through.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_war)[](https://news.sky.com/story/iran-claims-it-has-shot-down-four-israeli-jets-as-it-fires-missiles-in-response-to-fridays-attacks-13383379)

        <h3>Long-Term Implications</h3>
        <p>While Operation Rising Lion showcased Israel’s military prowess, its long-term success in halting Iran’s nuclear program remains uncertain. The Fordo facility, buried under a mountain, is resistant to conventional bunker busters, and experts suggest U.S. assistance with heavier munitions, like the GBU-57 MOP, may be needed.<span class="source"></span> Iran’s history of rebuilding after attacks, such as the Stuxnet cyberattack, indicates resilience in its nuclear program.</p>[](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/12/world/israel-iran-us-nuclear)[](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/16/nx-s1-5435292/israel-iran-missile-defense-nuclear)
        <p>Politically, the operation has escalated tensions, with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei threatening “severe punishment” and the U.S. expressing support for Israel but avoiding direct military involvement.<span class="source"></span> The conflict risks further regional destabilization, with potential involvement of Iran’s allies, like the Houthis, and protests in Tehran against foreign attacks.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-netanyahu)[](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj9vj8glg2o)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_war)

        <h2>Analysis: A Masterclass in Preemption with Uncertain Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Operation Rising Lion demonstrates Israel’s ability to integrate intelligence, special operations, and airpower to achieve strategic surprise. The Mossad’s covert preparations and the IDF’s precise execution highlight a “high-low mix” of advanced technology and proven platforms, offering lessons for Western militaries.<span class="source"></span> The operation’s success in degrading Iran’s air defenses and missile capabilities underscores the importance of pre-positioned assets and coordinated strikes.</p>[](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2025/june/iran-israel-conflict-quicklook-analysis-operation-rising-lion)[](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/by-fusing-intelligence-and-special-operations-israels-strikes-on-iran-are-a-lesson-in-strategic-surprise/)
        <p>However, the operation’s broader impact is less clear. While Israel achieved tactical dominance, the destruction of underground nuclear facilities remains incomplete, and Iran’s retaliatory strikes indicate its capacity to respond. The operation’s legal justification under anticipatory self-defense is debated, as diplomatic avenues, such as U.S.-Iran talks, were still ongoing.<span class="source"></span> Civilian casualties and damage to non-military targets, like hospitals, have drawn criticism and may complicate Israel’s international standing.<span class="source"></span></p>[](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/israels-operation-rising-lion-right-of-self-defense/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_war)
        <p>The operation’s outcome hinges on whether Israel can sustain its campaign and secure U.S. support for deeper strikes. Without neutralizing Fordo and Iran’s remaining centrifuges, the nuclear threat persists. Moreover, Iran’s ability to mobilize proxies and launch missile barrages suggests a prolonged conflict could strain Israel’s defenses and regional alliances.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Operation Rising Lion marks a bold escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict, showcasing Israel’s military and intelligence capabilities while exposing the challenges of dismantling a fortified nuclear program. The operation’s immediate successes—air superiority, leadership decapitation, and infrastructure damage—are tempered by Iran’s retaliatory capacity and the resilience of its nuclear facilities. As the conflict continues, the international community, particularly the U.S., faces pressure to mediate or escalate, with profound implications for Middle Eastern security. Operation Rising Lion may redefine the regional order, but its ultimate success depends on Israel’s ability to sustain its campaign and address Iran’s remaining capabilities.</p>
